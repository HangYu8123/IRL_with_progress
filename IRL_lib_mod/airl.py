        In Fu's AIRL paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.11248.pdf), the
        discriminator output was given as

        .. math::

            D_{\theta}(s,a) =
            \frac{ \exp{r_{\theta}(s,a)} } { \exp{r_{\theta}(s,a)} + \pi(a|s) }

        with a high value corresponding to the expert and a low value corresponding to
        the generator.

        In other words, the discriminator output is the probability that the action is
        taken by the expert rather than the generator.

        The logit of the above is given as

        .. math::

            \operatorname{logit}(D_{\theta}(s,a)) = r_{\theta}(s,a) - \log{ \pi(a|s) }

        which is what is returned by this function.

        Args:
            state: The state of the environment at the time of the action.
            action: The action taken by the expert or generator.
            next_state: The state of the environment after the action.
            done: whether a `terminal state` (as defined under the MDP of the task) has
                been reached.
